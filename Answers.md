1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing is handled internally by the JavaScript that is already on the page so that the entire page doesn't refresh when data is needed. Initial loading time may be slower but its faster overall as the whole page doesnt need to be refreshed when data is requested.

Server-side routing occurs when data is needed on a webpage that then is requested from a server. the server sends back a template or an HTML file and the entire page is refreshed. data lives on the server and is sent back and forth
